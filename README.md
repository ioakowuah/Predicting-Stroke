# Predicting-Stroke
This work was to bring forth the factors influencing stroke. As such, the approach chosen was to develop a predictive model using the provided train and test dataset. The programming or statistical package employed here was Python using data wrangling and visualization libraries Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib.pyplot. In modeling, classifiers chosen were Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistics Regression and XGBoost. Finally, the Maximum Hard Voting Ensemble Model was chosen to encompass base classifiers. Feature importance was used alongside to visualize pressing factors of stroke for each base classifier.
